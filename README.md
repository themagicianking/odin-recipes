This project is a demonstration of all that I have learned with TOP thus far with regards to HTML

It will demonstrate my ability to:
-write an html boilerplate
-use headings, paragraphs, lists, and links
-use images
-create bold and italic text with emphasis
-create a very basic but functioning website
