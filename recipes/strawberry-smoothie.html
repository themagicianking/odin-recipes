                <li>1 heaping spoonful of peanut butter</li>
                <li>3 scoops of vanilla ice cream</li>
                <li>several ice cubes, if using fresh strawberries</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Add the strawberries, milk, and ice if you are using any, to the blender. 
                    Blend until smooth.</li>
